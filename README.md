### API

Note: This API documentation template is extracted from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/edit/master/README.md).

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

-   [`getAll`](#getall)
-   [`update`](#update)
-   [`search`](#search)

#### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

-   Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
-   This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.
